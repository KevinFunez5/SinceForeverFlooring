Kevin Funez Capstone Idea
SinceForEver Flooring
This will be a website for a construction contractor. Customers will be able to view a photo gallery and schedule appointments. The admin will be able to schedule jobs and workers. 

-Photo Gallery
-Scheduling functionality
-Admin/authentication functionality 

-JavaScript/CSS/HTML
-C#
-Google Calendar API
-Google Maps API

If time permits, I would like the application to be able to send reminders to both parties about planned appointments. And the application could have the google maps API to show the owners office location!
